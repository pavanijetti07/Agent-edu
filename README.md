The "Agent Education" project, typically realized as an Intelligent Multi-Agent Tutoring System (IMATS), is an advanced application of AI agents designed to solve the critical education challenge of providing personalized, scalable, and adaptive learning support to every student.

The core goal is to shift education from a static, one-size-fits-all model to a dynamic, individualized learning journey by leveraging specialized AI agents.

🎯 Problem Solved
The project addresses the fundamental limitations of traditional education and simple e-learning platforms:

Lack of Personalization: Human teachers cannot realistically customize lessons for 30+ students simultaneously, leading to high-achievers being bored and struggling students being left behind.

Teacher Overburden: Educators spend too much time on repetitive tasks like routine grading and answering administrative questions, detracting from high-value mentorship and instructional design.

Inconsistent Support: High-quality, real-time tutoring is expensive and inaccessible, creating an equity gap.
